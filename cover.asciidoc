For What and For Whom
---------------------

WARNING: Attention! You have probably arrived at the wrong place, and are planning
to spend sometime on something you will be not interested.  So let us check
whether we should leave.

*For What*

This little book is about https://github.com/basho/riak_core[RiakCore], which
is an application framework for building distributed, scalable, fault-tolerant
applications. RiakCore is written in http://www.erlang.org[Erlang]
programming language, open sourced by http://www.basho.com[Basho
Technologies].  The application built with RiakCore, is usually for
serving purpose. Being different from what you use on your PC or
phone, application for serving should never stop, be always available, and
recover from some really bad disasters. So it is believed that servers are much
harder to be done right. If you are willing to write this kind of serious
programs -- servers, you can stay.

*For Whom*

Serious programmers write servers never going down. With years of experience in
backend programming, they have done enough of thinking how to distribute the
computing to nodes in server clusters, make the storage scalable, and clean up
this and that before bringing some crashed nodes back. Lots of programs in lots
of programming languages have been done. Hundreds of thousands of lines of code
have made the fun part gone. Then they learned some Erlang, and other cool
stuff such as
http://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/users_guide.html[OTP], and they
want to resolve these problems again in a more elegant, understandable way, and
most importantly, bring the fun parts back.  In short, if you have questions in
how to elegantly write an always-up, instantly-scalable servers, you can stay.

----
Do not scared by me, but except the Erlang part. For reading this
book, you have to at least be familar with how to write Erlang
programs. If you are not, one of the excellent book is
