For What and For Whom
---------------------

WARNING: Attention! You have probably arrived at the wrong place, and are planning
to spend sometime on something you will be not interested.  So let us check
whether we should leave.

*For What*

This little book is about https://github.com/basho/riak_core[RiakCore], which
is an application framework for building distributed, scalable, fault-tolerant
applications. RiakCore is written in http://www.erlang.org[Erlang]
programming language, open sourced by http://www.basho.com[Basho
Technologies].  The application built with RiakCore, is usually for
serving purpose. Being different from what you use on your PC or
phone, application for serving should never stop, be always available, and
recover from some really bad disasters. So it is believed that servers are much
harder to be done right. If you are willing to write this kind of serious
programs -- servers, you can stay.

*For Whom*

Serious programmers write servers never going down. With years of experience in
backend programming, they have done enough of thinking how to distribute the
computing to nodes in server clusters, make the storage scalable, and clean up
this and that before bringing some crashed nodes back. Lots of programs in lots
of programming languages have been done. Hundreds of thousands of lines of code
have made the fun part gone. Then they learned some Erlang, and other cool
stuff such as
http://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/users_guide.html[OTP], and they
want to resolve these problems again in a more elegant, understandable way, and
most importantly, bring the fun parts back.  In short, if you have questions in
how to elegantly write an always-up, instantly-scalable servers, you can stay.

But do not scared by me. :-) As long as you are interested in writing some cool
server stuff, you are welcome! RiakCore is made for ease the process of making
something distributed cool. Geeks (including me) love it and think it the
next-big-thing of server programming. But not everyone is geek. In this book, I
will make my best to explain the practice in programming RiakCore, in language
that everyone can follow and understand.

NOTE: But I am serious in the Erlang part. For reading this
book, you would better to be familar with writting Erlang
programs. If you are not, I know an excellent book for you to read. Its name is
http://learnyousomeerlang.com[Learn Your Some Erlang for great good!], or
shortly LYSE. Throughout this book, I will frequently reference LYSE, whenever
there is some Erlang stuff we would better to be aware of.
