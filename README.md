This is my fork of [try-try-try](https://github.com/rzezeski/try-try-try) and notes while I am learning it.

The original README.md is renamed to README.orig.md.

All episodes inside dir 2011 are moved out, and are prefixed with the order for reading.

And each episodes will be updated with the spirit try to catching following system configurations.

* Erlang/OTP version: R16
* riak_core version: 1.4.*
